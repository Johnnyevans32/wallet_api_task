# wallet_api_task

I used the bvn identity api to implement a detailed information about a customer using the bvn input.

To run the set up :

Install wampserver on your system

Add the repo file to the this directory on your computer 

C://wamp64/www/the repo file

Run wampserver 

Enter localhost/the repo file to your desktop browser.
